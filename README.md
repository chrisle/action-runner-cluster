# arc — GitHub Actions runner cluster orchestrator

One self-hosted runner cluster for every project in your org, across Linux,
Windows and macOS. Set a minimum and a maximum per pool; arc watches for queued
jobs, creates runners as work arrives, and destroys them completely when it
drains away.

Every runner is **ephemeral**: it takes exactly one job, unregisters itself, and
is deleted along with its entire filesystem. Nothing survives into the next job
— no caches, no checked-out repos, no toolchain downloads, no disk creeping
toward full.

## The one thing to know first

**Docker cannot run macOS runners.** Docker Desktop on a Mac runs Linux
containers inside a Linux VM — a "macOS container" would be a Linux runner that
cannot touch Xcode, code signing, or the iOS simulators. Apple does not permit
containerizing macOS, and no tool works around that.

So arc has two providers:

| Platform | Provider  | What a runner is                                                |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `docker`  | A container, destroyed after one job                             |
| Windows  | `docker`  | A Windows container (needs a Windows host in Windows-container mode) |
| macOS    | `process` | A runner process in a private, copy-on-write directory, deleted after one job |

`arc doctor` rejects a macOS pool configured for Docker rather than letting you
find out from a runner that mysteriously has no Xcode.

## How the disposal guarantee works

Both providers give you the same promise by different means:

- **Docker** — the container is removed with its anonymous volumes (`v=true`),
  so the whole writable layer goes. Optionally `work_tmpfs: true` puts the job
  workspace in RAM, so it never reaches disk at all.
- **Process** — a pristine, never-configured runner installation is cloned per
  job using APFS copy-on-write (`cp -Rc`), which is near-instant and costs
  almost no disk despite the runner being a few hundred megabytes. When the job
  finishes the entire clone is `rm -rf`'d.

The process provider's one honest limitation: anything a job writes *outside*
its instance directory — a real `~/Library` cache, `/tmp`, Homebrew — is beyond
its control. That is the unavoidable difference between a process and a
container. `RUNNER_TEMP` and `TMPDIR` are pointed inside the instance directory
to cover the common cases.

## Scaling

Each tick, for every pool:

```
desired = clamp(max(min, busy + queued), min, max)
```

`busy + queued` rather than just `queued` because runners are ephemeral: a
runner executing a job cannot also serve a queued one, so in-flight work and
waiting work both need capacity. `min` keeps warm runners so the first job of
the day doesn't pay full startup cost.

Scale-down is conservative on purpose:

- Only **idle** runners are ever removed. A busy one is executing someone's
  build. GitHub itself refuses to deregister a busy runner (422), which is the
  backstop if the orchestrator's view is stale.
- A surplus runner must be continuously idle for `idle_timeout` before it goes,
  so a burst of jobs arriving seconds apart doesn't thrash create/destroy.
- Ephemeral runners exit on their own after one job anyway, so most scale-down
  is just arc reaping what already finished and topping back up to `min`.

### Which pool gets a job

A pool can serve a job when the pool's labels are a **superset** of the job's
`runs-on` labels — the same rule GitHub uses to route work. When several pools
qualify, the one with the fewest extra labels wins, so a plain
`runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]` job doesn't consume your scarce
`linux + gpu` machines. If the best-fit pool is at `max`, the job spills to
another eligible pool instead of waiting.

Jobs targeting GitHub-hosted images (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-14`, …) are
ignored — GitHub runs those itself, and treating them as demand would spin up
local runners that never receive work.

## Setup

### 1. Build

```sh
make build            # ./bin/arc
make install          # into $GOPATH/bin
make release          # cross-compiled binaries in dist/
```

No runtime dependencies — it is a single static binary.

### 2. Credentials

Either a classic PAT with the **`admin:org`** scope:

```sh
export GITHUB_ORG=your-org
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

…or, better for anything long-lived, a GitHub App with
**`organization_self_hosted_runners: write`**. Installation tokens are minted
hourly and scoped to the installation, and there's no personal account whose
departure breaks the cluster:

```yaml
github:
  org: your-org
  app:
    app_id: 123456
    installation_id: 7890123
    private_key_path: /etc/arc/app-key.pem
```

### 3. Runner images and templates

```sh
# Linux (build for the arch you run on, or multi-arch)
make image-linux REGISTRY=ghcr.io/your-org
make image-linux-multiarch REGISTRY=ghcr.io/your-org

# Windows — must run ON a Windows host with Docker Desktop in Windows-container mode
make image-windows REGISTRY=ghcr.io/your-org

# macOS — run once on the Mac that will host runners
make macos-template
```

The images contain an **unconfigured** runner. arc pre-registers each runner
with GitHub and passes a just-in-time config at start, so one image serves every
pool and every project, and nothing in it is tied to an org.

### 4. Configure

```sh
cp config.example.yaml arc.yaml
$EDITOR arc.yaml
arc doctor
```

`arc doctor` checks the config, the credentials and their scopes, repo
visibility, every Docker daemon, and every runner template — and reports all
failures at once rather than stopping at the first.

### 5. Run

```sh
arc run
```

As a service: `deploy/systemd/arc.service` (Linux),
`deploy/launchd/com.arc.orchestrator.plist` (macOS — must be a **LaunchAgent**,
not a LaunchDaemon, or code signing will fail),
`deploy/windows/install-service.ps1` (Windows).

### 6. Removing a host

```sh
arc uninstall                  # -keep-config to leave a reinstall one command away
```

It stops and removes the service, destroys this host's runners and deregisters
them from GitHub, deletes this host's webhooks, and removes the files arc
created. It shows what it will do and asks first (`-yes` skips the prompt).

A runner executing a job stops it: uninstalling would fail a live build, so it
names the runners and exits without changing anything. `-force` overrides that.
Other arc hosts on the same account are never touched — runner names and webhook
paths carry a host id, and only this host's are removed.

Two things are deliberately left behind: `~/.arc/env`, `/etc/arc/env` and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\arc\op-token.txt`, because you put those credentials there, and
the binary itself.

## Host tooling for process pools

Docker pools get their tools from the image. **Process pools get them from the
host**: each ephemeral runner is a clean clone of the runner template, but it
executes directly on the machine, so every CLI a workflow step calls must
already be installed there. `setup-*` actions that download their own toolchain
(`actions/setup-node`, `swatinem/rust-cache`) still work; anything a workflow
assumes was preinstalled on a GitHub-hosted image does not.

What the current fleet needed to take over a Tauri desktop-app release
workflow (build + sign + notarize on macOS, build + Azure Trusted Signing on
Windows, publish via `gh` on Linux) — a reasonable checklist for similar
workloads:

| Pool | Host-provided tools |
| --- | --- |
| linux | `gh`, `jq`, plus the runner system libs (`installdependencies.sh`) |
| macos | Xcode Command Line Tools, `rustup` |
| windows | VS Build Tools 2022 (MSVC), Windows SDK (`signtool`), `pwsh` 7, .NET 8 runtime, `rustup` |

Three gotchas:

- **PATH is captured when arc starts.** Runners inherit arc's environment, so a
  tool installed after arc came up (e.g. `rustup-init` appending to the Windows
  user PATH) is invisible to jobs until arc restarts. Restart when
  `/v1/status` shows `busy: 0`.
- **On Windows, `bash` must be Git Bash — not WSL.** Actions runs every
  `shell: bash` step, and the bash half of many composite actions
  (`dtolnay/rust-toolchain` among them), through whatever `bash` PATH resolves
  to first. If that is WSL's app-execution alias under `WindowsApps`, every one
  of those steps fails with a mangled path:

  ```
  /bin/bash: C:Userschris.arcinstances..._temp_xyz.sh: No such file or directory
  ```

  WSL bash cannot open a Windows path, and the backslashes vanish as escapes.
  GitHub-hosted runners ship Git Bash first on PATH; a workstation usually does
  not. Fix it for runners alone by prepending `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` in
  arc's launcher script rather than to the user PATH, so interactive shells
  keep whatever `bash` their owner expects.
- Keep host tools out of the runner template itself — templates must stay
  unconfigured and generic.

## Topology

Run **one** orchestrator. It polls GitHub once and drives every pool:

```
                      ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                      │  arc  (one process)          │
   GitHub API ◀──────▶│  polls queued jobs           │
                      │  mints JIT runner configs    │
                      └───┬───────────┬───────────┬──┘
        unix:// socket    │           │           │   ssh://
                          ▼           ▼           ▼
                   Linux docker   macOS process   Windows docker
                   (containers)   (cloned dirs)   (Windows containers)
```

Remote daemons are reached over `ssh://user@host`, which uses your existing SSH
keys and exposes no daemon port. `tcp://` with client certificates works too;
unauthenticated `tcp://` does not, deliberately.

Two orchestrators against one org would both poll and both scale, fighting over
the same demand signal. Don't.

## Adjusting min and max

Live, without a restart, persisted across restarts:

```sh
arc scale linux --max 16        # raise the ceiling for a big migration
arc scale linux --min 3         # keep more warm
arc scale linux --reset         # back to the config file's values

arc drain windows               # stop creating; running jobs finish untouched
arc resume windows
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `arc run` | Start the orchestrator |
| `arc install [-max N]` | Install and start the background service |
| `arc start` / `arc stop` | Control the installed service |
| `arc uninstall [-yes] [-force] [-keep-config]` | Remove the service, this host's runners and arc's files |
| `arc status [-wide] [-json] [-watch 2s]` | Pools, runners, queued jobs |
| `arc scale <pool> [-min N] [-max N] [-reset]` | Change limits at runtime |
| `arc drain <pool>` / `arc resume <pool>` | Stop / restart runner creation |
| `arc logs <pool> <instance-id>` | Tail a runner's output |
| `arc doctor` | Check everything before it bites you |

`GET /metrics` on the control API serves Prometheus gauges for live, busy, idle,
desired, queued and rate-limit remaining.

## API cost

There is no org-wide "list queued jobs" endpoint, so arc walks each repo's
active workflow runs. Every request is conditional on an ETag, and GitHub does
not charge a `304` against the rate limit — so quiet repos are free to poll.

If your org is large, narrow the work with `github.repos`:

```yaml
github:
  poll_interval: 15s
  repos:
    active_within: 720h        # skip repos with no push in 30 days
    include: ["service-*"]
    exclude: ["archived-*"]
```

`arc doctor` warns when your poll interval and repo count could outrun the
limit.

## Security notes

- The control API binds to loopback and changes scaling and reads runner logs.
  Set `server.token` if you must expose it, and put TLS in front of it.
- `docker_in_docker: true` gives every workflow in the org root-equivalent
  control of that host's Docker daemon. It is off by default for that reason.
- Self-hosted runners and public repositories are a bad combination in general:
  anyone who can open a pull request can run code on your machine. The
  ephemeral-container model limits the blast radius but does not eliminate it.
  GitHub's own guidance is to use self-hosted runners with private repos only.

## What's deliberately not here

- **Webhooks.** Polling with conditional requests costs little and needs no
  public endpoint, no tunnel and no inbound firewall rule.
- **Config hot-reload.** Limits change live with `arc scale`; anything else is a
  restart, which is cheap because runners are ephemeral and are left to finish.
- **Tart / VM runners.** The provider interface has room for it. macOS VMs would
  give per-job isolation the process provider can't, at a real cost in startup
  time and disk.

## Development

```sh
make check          # fmt, vet, test
make test-unit      # skip the tests that need a Docker daemon
make crosscheck     # verify all five target platforms still compile
```

The Docker integration tests run against your local daemon, create real
containers under a test-only pool label, and clean up after themselves. They
skip automatically when no daemon is reachable.
